## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive Website
- Mobile-first workflow
- Prettier
- Git & Github
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) - React framework
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### Continued development

I would like to add animations for each part of this project like the <img> in Features component when users click another tab and then when user open this website for the first time I want to make it more attractive for the users.

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This helped me to do the styling more easy. I really liked this tailwindcss and will use it going forward.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) - This is an amazing website which helped me to upload my website into the internet. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning to use this website.
